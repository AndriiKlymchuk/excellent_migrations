# ExcellentMigrations [WIP]

An Elixir lib that detects unsafe migrations. 

It's similar to a great Ruby gem: [strong_migrations](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `excellent_migrations` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:excellent_migrations, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/excellent_migrations](https://hexdocs.pm/excellent_migrations).
